## Sprint 1 Review Report

### Sprint Goal
Complete course tasks.

### Completed User Stories / Tasks
This is typical for an early sprint where the team is still orienting itself. Work was done, but no user stories reached the “Done” stage, likely due to a few things.
Prioritizing course-related assignments,
needing more time to set up tools and align on the project direction
 and spending time on early design and experimentation instead of coding features

### Demo Summary
Visual proof of concept of the program UI.

### What Went Well
There is a clear idea of the final product.

### What Could Be Improved
Allocate more time to working on the project, not just course assignments. <br>
Complete assignments more urgently and communicate responsibilties more clearly.

### Next Sprint Focus
Coding the project program.
